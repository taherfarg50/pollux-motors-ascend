## Current Status

The `luxury_sedan.glb` file is currently empty (0 bytes) and needs to be replaced with a proper 3D model file.

## Fallback Solution

The AR/VR Car Viewer component has been enhanced with robust error handling and includes a **procedurally generated 3D car fallback** that provides:

- ✅ Interactive 3D car visualization
- ✅ Color customization (6 premium colors)
- ✅ Smooth animations and floating effects
- ✅ All AR/VR viewer features
- ✅ Realistic materials and lighting

## To Add a Proper 3D Model

1. **Replace** `luxury_sedan.glb` with a proper GLB/GLTF file
2. **Ensure** the file is properly formatted and not empty
3. **Test** that it loads correctly in the browser

## Recommended 3D Model Specifications

- **Format**: GLB (preferred) or GLTF
- **Polycount**: 5,000-50,000 triangles for web performance
- **Size**: Under 10MB for fast loading
- **Materials**: PBR materials with metalness/roughness workflow
- **UV Mapping**: Proper UV mapping for texture application

## Current Fallback Features

The fallback model includes:
- Realistic car body with rounded edges
- Proper proportions and scaling
- Dynamic material properties
- Interactive hotspots and annotations
- Support for all viewer modes (3D/AR/VR)

The fallback ensures users get a complete experience even without the original model file.
